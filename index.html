<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr />
Having searched for many years for a usable Linux window manager that both appealed to my sense of aesthetics and had at least some of the features I feel necessary for a 'proper' WM; in all that time I only came across one which, at least partially, fit the bill.
<br />
<br />
mavosxwm was the creation of Martin Vollrathson and hadn't been updated since sometime in 2003. His website for mavosxwm has long since stopped working; but here is an image of the about page that I have managed to find:
<br />

<br />
After obtaining permission from him in 2007, I forked Mavosxwm v0.2.1 to use as the base from which I will write kowm. I will be recycling and rearranging some of its parts and pieces; these bits are, even now, making their way into various locations in kowm-core.
<br />
<br />
For the record, kowm itself stands for Kobol's Own Window Manager; in like manner all related icons, artwork, and documentation should reflect this.
<br />
<br />
The modules themselves are to be named for the twelve colonies of man and various non-aligned colonies from the original Battlestar Galactica, circa 1978-1979.
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm</h2>
<hr />
kowm ( /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-core</h2>
<hr />
kowm-core is made up of six modular desktop libraries; five handle the basic features that make for a beautifully simple window manager and the sixth is a framework for building, attaching, and manipulating new modular extensions. Since speed is of the essence here, we're planning on writing kowm-core in C++.
<br />
<br />
caprica provides low-level constructs shared by all 'windows'; including the root window.<br />
gemoni provide basic workspace management and functionality.<br />
leonis provides the graphics subsystem from which all graphics toolkit modules can hook into and manipulate objects.<br />
sagitara provides a basic module structure, attachment points and shared asset management funtions.<br />
piscera provides automatic menu generation of the system menu, the desktop menu and the application menus.<br />
virgon provides all remaining mid- and high-level 'window' management<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-opts</h2>
<hr />
komw-opts /kōm-äpts/ currently has six additional modular libraries planned. These libraries - along with any others we think are needed - will provide additional services that, while not absolutely necessary, would probably be appreciated by the end user. These libraries will most likely be written in Ruby; however additional bindings for Python and Lua are currently on the RoadMap.
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-apps</h2>
<hr />
Finally, we're planning other apps the we deem useful to the overall desktop experience. These will reside within the kowm-apps project. kowm-apps can use any language for which exists a language binding or a new one if you or a friend have the knowledge to write one; don't fret too much, it's not a difficult task. That being said, we definitely are expecting the first few to be all Ruby.
