<h1>kowm</h1>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm.acommitteeoflunatics.com/kowm.html">kowm</a> ( /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we here at <i>a Committee of Lunatics</i> tend to agree.
<br />

kowm, upon it's release, will include the following...
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-core</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm-core.acommitteeoflunatics.com">kowm-core</a> ( /kōm-kôr/ ) is made up of six modular desktop libraries; five handle the basic features that make for a beautifully simple window manager and the sixth is a framework for building, attaching, and manipulating new modular extensions. Since speed is of the essence here, we're planning on writing kowm-core in C++.
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-opts</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm-opts.acommitteeoflunatics.com">kowm-opts</a> ( /kōm-äpts/ ) currently has six additional modular libraries planned. These libraries - along with any others we think are needed - will provide additional services that, while not absolutely necessary, would probably be appreciated by the end user. These libraries will most likely be written in Ruby; however additional bindings for Python and Lua are currently on the RoadMap.
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-apps</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm-apps.acommitteeoflunatics.com">kowm-apps</a> ( /kōm-æps/ ) are, collectively, any apps written using the kowm libraries; these are usually intended to be optionally included with any working kowm-desktop if a user so desires. These will reside within the kowm-apps project. kowm-apps can use any language for which exists a language binding or a new one if you or a friend have the knowledge to write one; don't fret too much, it's not a difficult task. That being said, we definitely are expecting the first few to be all Ruby.
