<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr />
Having searched for many years for a usable Linux window manager that both appealed to my sense of aesthetics and had at least some of the features I feel necessary for a 'proper' WM; in all that time I only came across one which, at least partially, fit the bill.
<br />
<br />
<a href="mavosxwm.sourceforge.net">mavosxwm</a> was the creation of Martin Vollrathson and hadn't been updated since sometime in 2003. The mavosxwm website, except for the outdated news page has long since stopped functioning; but below is the only image of the about page that I have managed to find. All information in the image, and in fact the image itself, can be considered his intellectual property and is used here only for informational purposes.

<br />
<br />
I, like Martin, am quite insane; but I digress...
<br />
<br />
After obtaining permission from him in 2007, I forked Mavosxwm v0.2.1 to use as the base from which I will write kowm. I will be recycling and rearranging some of its parts and pieces; these bits are, even now, making their way into various locations in kowm-core.
<br />
<br />
For the record, kowm itself stands for Kobol's Own Window Manager; in like manner all related icons, artwork, and documentation should reflect this.
<br />
<br />
The modules themselves are to be named for the twelve colonies of man and various non-aligned colonies from the original Battlestar Galactica, circa 1978-1979.

<h2>kowm</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm.acommitteeoflunatics.com/kowm">kowm</a> ( /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.
<br />
<br />
<br />
kowm is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license whose text can be found <a href="http://kowm.acommitteeoflunatics.com/copyright.html">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
kowm, upon it's release, will include the following...
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-core</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm-core.acommitteeoflunatics.com">kowm-core</a> ( /kōm-kôr/ ) is made up of six modular desktop libraries; five handle the basic features that make for a beautifully simple window manager and the sixth is a framework for building, attaching, and manipulating new modular extensions. Since speed is of the essence here, we're planning on writing kowm-core in C++.
<br />
<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>caprica provides low-level constructs shared by all 'windows'; including the root window.</li>
<li>gemoni provide basic workspace management and functionality.</li>
<li>leonis provides the graphics subsystem from which all graphics toolkit modules can hook into and manipulate objects.</li>
<li>sagitara provides a basic module structure, attachment points and shared asset management funtions.</li>
<li>piscera provides automatic menu generation of the system menu, the desktop menu and the application menus.</li>
<li>virgon provides all remaining mid- and high-level 'window' management</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-opts</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm-opts.acommitteeoflunatics.com">kowm-opts</a> ( /kōm-äpts/ ) currently has six additional modular libraries planned. These libraries - along with any others we think are needed - will provide additional services that, while not absolutely necessary, would probably be appreciated by the end user. These libraries will most likely be written in Ruby; however additional bindings for Python and Lua are currently on the RoadMap.
<br />
<br />
<h2>kowm-apps</h2>
<hr />
<a href="http://kowm-apps.acommitteeoflunatics.com">kowm-apps</a> ( /kōm-æps/ ) are, collectively, any apps written using the kowm libraries; these are usually intended to be optionally included with any working kowm-desktop if a user so desires. These will reside within the kowm-apps project. kowm-apps can use any language for which exists a language binding or a new one if you or a friend have the knowledge to write one; don't fret too much, it's not a difficult task. That being said, we definitely are expecting the first few to be all Ruby.
