## kowm
kowm ( /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the 
only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided 
that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.

## kowm-opts
komw-opts /kōm-äpts/ currently has six additional modular libraries planned. 
These libraries - along with any others we think are needed - will provide 
additional services that, while not absolutely necessary, would probably be 
appreciated by the end user. These libraries will most likely be written in 
Ruby; however additional bindings for Python and Lua are currently on the 
RoadMap.
