## kowm
kowm ( /k≈çm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the 
only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided 
that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.

## kowm-opts
There are currently six additional modular libraries planned which, along 
with any others we think are needed, will make up kowm-opts. These libraries 
will most likely be written in Ruby; however additional bindings for Python 
and Lua are currently on the RoadMap
