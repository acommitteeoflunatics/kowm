## kowm
kowm ( :speaker: /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the 
only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided 
that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.

## kowm-apps
kowm-apps ( :speaker: /kōm-æps/ ) are, collectively, any apps written using the kowm 
libraries; these are usually intended to be optionally included with any working 
kowm-desktop if a user so desires.

## Requirements
At present, the only requirements for kowm-opts is a properly configured kowm-core; this
may change during development on an as-needed basis.

## Planned Modules
Currently planned module names are listed below; descriptions will be added as decisions 
are made. Ideas for matching application or tool functions to the individual names below
is encouraged; those which make it into the final product will be credited whomever 
publicly made them first to the dev team.
