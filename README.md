## kowm
kowm ( :speaker: /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the 
only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided 
that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.

## kowm-apps
kowm-apps ( :speaker: /kōm-æps/ ) are, collectively, any apps written using the kowm 
libraries; these are usually intended to be optionally included with any working 
kowm-desktop if a user so desires.

### Requirements
At present, the only requirements for kowm-apps is a properly configured kowm-core; this
may change during development on an as-needed basis.

### Libraries

-   `appsFiler` simple file manager that sees all filesystems as objects, to be opened, read from and written to.
