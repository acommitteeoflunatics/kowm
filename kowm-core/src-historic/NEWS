Changes between 0.2 and 0.2.1:

  * Some _really_ annoying and obvious bugs fixed.

Changes between 0.1 and 0.2:

  * Aspect ratio hints are supported. This is used by clients such as mplayer
    who wants to keep the aspect ratio intact when resizing the window.
  * If the window manager is restarted, clients will reappear on the same
    workspace they were on when the window manager was terminated.
  * Transient windows automatically receive input focus when they are mapped
    if their owner currently has input focus. They are also centered on their
    owner.
  * There is now a context menu for clients. ALT + Button3 on the client.
  * Inactive clients have grayscaled decorations.
  * Decorations looks better.
  * The title in the window frame can be updated by the client.
  * Windows can be "sticky" - visible on all workspaces.
  * Window frames have 3 buttons.
