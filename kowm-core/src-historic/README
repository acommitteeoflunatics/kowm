RELEASE NOTES FOR MAVOSXWM 0.2.1

There are still many things to fix, I can't list all of them here, however:
  Do not make a window with aspect ratio very small. Inifinite loop.
  Do not yet use this window manager on a system with more than one X11 screen.

As I've said before, be careful. This window manager SHOULD work be I do not
make any guarantees that it actually does.

To build it, Xft-2.0 and Glib-2.0 are required.

NEWS contains the changes that might be interesting to the user.
ChangeLog contains all changes.

Before the config system is fixed, all key and button bindings are hard coded.

Button1 on title raises and moves window.
Button1 on borders raises resizes window.
Button2 on title resizes window.
Button2 on borders moves window.
Button3 on title or borders lowers window.

Button1 + ALT on client moves window.
Button2 + ALT on client resizes window.
Button3 + ALT on client displays context menu.

CTRL + ALT + Left switches to previous workspace.
CTRL + ALT + Right switches to next workspace.

There are currently 4 hard coded workspaces.
