## kowm
kowm ( /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the 
only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided 
that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree.

## kowm-apps
kowm-apps /kōm-æps/ are, collectively, any apps written using the kowm 
libraries; these are usually intended to be optionally included with any working 
kowm-desktop if a user so desires.
